ETC/CA LULUCF repository:

In this EEA repository the work done for the creation of a carbon sequestration potential map compatible with the LULUCF regulation will be shared. Furthermore, some notebooks will be made available to allow user interaction for the creation of the carbon potential maps for different scenarios. 

Repo structure:
* Scripts --> Python scripts -which should be used to start the process

* notebooks --> Showcase notebook on how to use satellite data for carbon sequestration mapping 
* flowcharts --> Flowcharts that visualize the process used to within the notebooks for carbon sequestration mapping
* src --> in this folder and the subfolders the source code used for running the process are stored
